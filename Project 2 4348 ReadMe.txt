Project 2 4348

To compile this Project, you need to use a compiler that can run C++ code. 
Once you open the compiler, open the Project2.cpp file from the folder it is 
located in and use a terminal or shell to run the code with the commands:
g++ -o project2 project2.cpp -pthread
once that compiles, use ./project2 to execute the program.
The program will output the philosophers thinking and eating cycles
with a final summary of what they have done.
